      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi, My name is Aashna Kundra and currently I am in 3<sup
        >rd</sup>semester of Computer Programming and Analysis (CPA).
      </p>
      <p>I want to become a software/ web developer in future.I always like
        programming and was always fascinated by how a particular app works.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of my studies, I really like to play Badminton, Table Tennis,
        sometimes like to paint and draw as well.</p>
      <p>I always like programming and was always fascinated by how a particular
        app works.
      </p>
      <p>I was always am introvert kind of a person, but I have realised that it
        is super important to express what you feel inside in your heart to the
        people around you. I am trying to change myself, in order to become an
        extrovert, but still that introvert side of me, will always be there.
      </p>
      <p>The other people in my life which matters to me the most are my parents
        especially my father. I have always believed that whatever decisions he
        has taken for me, have always been the best.
      </p>
      <p>That's was all about me!!!!</p>
